# Find Your Hat

This is a challenge project I did as part of my full stack engineer course on [Codecademy](https://codecademy.com). The program is an interactive terminal game in which the player has lost their hat in a field full of holes, with their task being to find their way to the hat without falling into one of the holes or leaving the field.
