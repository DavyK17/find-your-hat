# Find Your Hat

This is a challenge project I did as part of my full stack engineer course on [Codecademy](https://codecademy.com). The program is an interactive terminal game in which the player has lost their hat in a field full of holes, with their task being to find their way to the hat without falling into one of the holes or leaving the field.

The program can be run on any Node.js-supported command line interface (CLI), but the following instructions are specific to Windows as that is the operating system that I personally use and am most familiar with.

## Requirements
The program requires Node.js to work in your CLI. To install Node.js on your computer, visit https://nodejs.org/en/. If you'd like a step-by-step guide, [this W3Schools tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_get_started.asp) provides simple instructions for users to follow.

## Running the program
To download the program to your computer, click on the **green "Code" button** above and select **Download ZIP**. If you're unfamiliar with navigating between directories on Command Prompt, be sure to extract the files to your `C:\Users\<username>` folder; otherwise, you may [read this article](https://www.howtogeek.com/659411/how-to-change-directories-in-command-prompt-on-windows-10/) for a quick tutorial on how to change directories.

To run the program from the working directory, use the command `node main.js`.
